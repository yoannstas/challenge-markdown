### A funny story
A few years ago I went to New York with my best friend. What a great diverse city that is. We clearly saw that when we got invites for a cool rooftop party full of fashionably and hip people. We were so amazed by the party that we decided to go back to that club the night after. Looks like this wasn't a good idea since we actually ended up strumbling on a night full of naked men - you get the picture right? 

#####  TL;DR
One party is clearly not the other party!
